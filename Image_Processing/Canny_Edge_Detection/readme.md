# CANNY EDGE DETECTION

The purpose of detecting sharp changes/edges in image brightness is to capture important events, Thus, applying an edge detection algorithm to an image may significantly reduce the amount of data to be processed and may therefore filter out information/data that may be regarded as less relevant.
